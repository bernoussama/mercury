	Long: `Mercury is a lightweight DNS server that provides DNS resolution for a given set of zones.
This server is designed to be used as as recursive resolver and a sinkhole, blocking unwanted DNS requests.

- Recursive resolver
- Blocklist for unwanted domains
- Simple and easy to use command-line interface

Example usage:
$ mercury serve

	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.

	// will be global for your application.

	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&cfgFile, "config", "", "config file (default is $HOME/.mercury.yaml)")

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
	// when this action is called directly.
