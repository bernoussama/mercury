# Mercury

Mercury is a light DNS server implementation from scratch in Go

## Capabilities

- Recursive resolver - resolves directly using the Internet root servers by default, eliminating the need to trust any external name servers.
- Authoritative server for your own zones.
- DNS sinkhole - (dns-level ad-block)
- Caches DNS queries
- Handles concurrent clients
